# BitcoinTicker-iOS12-master

# Our Goal
The objective of this challenge is to apply the skills in the Clima project and make a Bitcoin price reporter. I am going to revisit how to use Cocoapods, networking calls and JSON parsing. This will be the most advanced challenge that will face to date. I believe in Myself!

# What you will create
I am going to make a Bitcoin price ticker. The app will give you the latest Bitcoin prices in all the popular, traded currencies, so you can track how well Bitcoin investments are doing on the go.
